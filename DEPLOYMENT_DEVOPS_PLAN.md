# Deployment and DevOps Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for deploying and managing the web-based IDE, ensuring a reliable, scalable, and secure production environment.

## Goals

1.  **Automated Deployment**: Automate the deployment process to reduce manual effort and errors.
2.  **High Availability**: Ensure that the application is highly available and can handle failures.
3.  **Scalability**: Ensure that the application can scale to meet the demands of a large number of users.
4.  **Security**: Ensure that the production environment is secure and protected from threats.

## CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run test:unit
      - run: npm run test:integration

  build:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - name: Build and push Docker images
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: my-registry/gemini-ide:${{ github.sha }}

  deploy:
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to production
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.SSH_HOST }}
          username: ${{ secrets.SSH_USERNAME }}
          key: ${{ secrets.SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            docker pull my-registry/gemini-ide:${{ github.sha }}
            docker-compose up -d
```

## Infrastructure

-   **Cloud Provider**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
-   **Containerization**: Docker
-   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (managed service)
-   **Caching**: Redis (managed service)
-   **Load Balancer**: Application Load Balancer (ALB) or similar
-   **CDN**: Cloudflare or similar

## Monitoring and Logging

-   **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana
-   **Logging**: ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a managed service like Datadog
-   **Alerting**: Alertmanager or PagerDuty

## Security

-   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use a tool like Trivy to scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
-   **Secrets Management**: Use a tool like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage secrets.
-   **Network Security**: Use a firewall and security groups to restrict access to the production environment.
-   **Intrusion Detection**: Use a tool like Falco to detect and respond to security threats.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

-   **Database Backups**: Perform regular backups of the database and store them in a secure location.
-g   **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Have a disaster recovery plan in place to restore the application in the event of a failure.
-   **Testing**: Regularly test the disaster recovery plan to ensure that it works as expected.
