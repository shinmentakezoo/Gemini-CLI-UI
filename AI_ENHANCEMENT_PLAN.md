# AI Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the existing Gemini CLI integration with advanced AI features, providing a powerful AI-assisted coding experience.

## Goals

1.  **Context-Aware Assistance**: Provide AI assistance that is aware of the user's code, project, and intent.
2.  **Code Generation and Transformation**: Enable AI-powered code generation, refactoring, and optimization.
3.  **Intelligent Debugging**: Use AI to help users debug their code and find the root cause of issues.
4.  **Seamless Integration**: Integrate AI features seamlessly into the editor, debugger, and other parts of the IDE.

## Technical Architecture

### AI Service

```typescript
// AI Service
interface AiService {
  getCodeCompletion(context: CodeContext): Promise<Completion[]>;
  getRefactoringSuggestions(context: CodeContext): Promise<Refactoring[]>;
  getCodeReview(context: CodeContext): Promise<CodeReview>;
  getDebuggingAssistance(context: DebugContext): Promise<DebuggingSuggestion[]>;
}

// Code Context
interface CodeContext {
  filePath: string;
  language: string;
  code: string;
  selection?: Selection;
}

// Debug Context
interface DebugContext {
  error: Error;
  stackTrace: StackFrame[];
  variables: Variable[];
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Context-Aware Completions (Week 1-2)

1.  **Contextual Information**: Gather contextual information from the editor, such as the current file, language, and cursor position.
2.  **AI Service**: Implement an AI service that sends the context to the Gemini API and gets code completion suggestions.
3.  **Editor Integration**: Integrate the AI service with Monaco Editor's completion provider to show AI-powered completions.

### Phase 2: Code Generation and Transformation (Week 3-4)

1.  **Code Generation**: Implement a feature that allows users to generate code from natural language descriptions.
2.  **Refactoring**: Add AI-powered refactoring suggestions, such as "extract function" or "rename variable".
3.  **Code Review**: Create a code review feature that uses AI to find potential issues and suggest improvements.

### Phase 3: Intelligent Debugging (Week 5)

1.  **Error Analysis**: Use AI to analyze error messages and stack traces and provide explanations and suggestions.
2.  **Debugging Assistance**: Implement a debugging assistant that can help users find the root cause of issues and suggest fixes.
3.  **Debugger Integration**: Integrate the intelligent debugging features with the debugging system.

### Phase 4: Polish and User Feedback (Week 6)

1.  **UI/UX Refinement**: Refine the UI/UX of the AI features to make them intuitive and easy to use.
2.  **User Feedback**: Gather user feedback and iterate on the AI features to improve their quality and usefulness.
3.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for the AI enhancement features.

## Security Considerations

-   **Data Privacy**: Ensure that user code and other sensitive information is not sent to the AI service without their consent.
-   **Prompt Injection**: Sanitize all input sent to the AI service to prevent prompt injection attacks.
-   **Model Bias**: Be aware of the potential for model bias and take steps to mitigate it.
