# Extension System Architecture Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for designing and implementing an extension system for the web-based IDE, allowing for the addition of new features and integrations by third-party developers.

## Goals

1.  **Extensibility**: Provide a powerful and flexible API for extensions to enhance the IDE's functionality.
2.  **Security**: Ensure that extensions run in a secure and isolated environment.
3.  **Performance**: Minimize the performance impact of running extensions.
4.  **Discoverability**: Create a marketplace for users to discover and install extensions.

## Technical Architecture

### Extension Host

```typescript
// Extension Host
interface ExtensionHost {
  loadExtension(extensionId: string): Promise<Extension>;
  activateExtension(extensionId: string): Promise<void>;
  deactivateExtension(extensionId: string): void;
  getExtension(extensionId: string): Extension | undefined;
}

// Extension
interface Extension {
  id: string;
  manifest: ExtensionManifest;
  api: ExtensionAPI;
  
  activate(): Promise<void>;
  deactivate(): void;
}
```

### Extension API

```typescript
// Extension API
interface ExtensionAPI {
  // Workspace
  workspace: {
    rootPath: string | undefined;
    getWorkspaceFolders(): WorkspaceFolder[] | undefined;
  };
  
  // Window
  window: {
    activeTextEditor: TextEditor | undefined;
    showInformationMessage(message: string): void;
    showErrorMessage(message: string): void;
  };
  
  // Commands
  commands: {
    registerCommand(command: string, callback: (...args: any[]) => any): Disposable;
    executeCommand<T = unknown>(command: string, ...rest: any[]): Promise<T | undefined>;
  };
  
  // Languages
  languages: {
    registerCompletionItemProvider(selector: DocumentSelector, provider: CompletionItemProvider): Disposable;
    registerHoverProvider(selector: DocumentSelector, provider: HoverProvider): Disposable;
  };
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Extension System (Week 1-2)

1.  **Extension Host**: Implement an extension host that can load and run extensions in a separate process (e.g., a Web Worker).
2.  **Extension API**: Define and implement a core set of APIs for extensions to interact with the IDE.
3.  **Manifest Handling**: Implement a system for parsing and validating extension manifests (`package.json`).
4.  **Basic Extension**: Create a simple "Hello World" extension to test the core system.

### Phase 2: API Expansion (Week 3-4)

1.  **Workspace API**: Add APIs for accessing workspace information and files.
2.  **Window API**: Add APIs for interacting with the UI, such as showing messages and notifications.
3.  **Editor API**: Add APIs for interacting with the text editor, such as reading and modifying text.
4.  **Language Features API**: Add APIs for contributing language features, such as completions and hovers.

### Phase 3: Marketplace and Management (Week 5-6)

1.  **Extension Marketplace**: Create a UI for browsing, searching, and installing extensions.
2.  **Extension Management**: Implement a system for enabling, disabling, and uninstalling extensions.
3.  **Packaging and Publishing**: Create tools for developers to package and publish their extensions to the marketplace.
4.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for the extension system.

## Security Considerations

-   **Sandboxing**: Run extensions in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Web Worker or an iframe) to isolate them from the main application.
-   **Permissions**: Implement a permission system to control what APIs extensions can access.
-   **Code Signing**: Consider using code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of extensions.
-   **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Use a strict CSP to prevent extensions from loading unauthorized scripts or resources.
