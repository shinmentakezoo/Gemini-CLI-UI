# Advanced Git Features Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating advanced Git features into the web-based IDE, providing a comprehensive Git experience similar to VS Code.

## Goals

1.  **Visual Diff Viewer**: Provide a side-by-side diff viewer for comparing file changes.
2.  **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Implement a UI for resolving merge conflicts.
3.  **Git History Visualization**: Create a visual representation of the Git history.
4.  **Branch Management**: Enhance the existing branch management features.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (UI)

```typescript
// Diff Viewer Component
interface DiffViewer {
  showDiff(file: string, oldContent: string, newContent: string): void;
}

// Merge Conflict Resolver Component
interface MergeConflictResolver {
  resolveConflict(file: string, conflict: Conflict): Promise<void>;
}

// Git History Component
interface GitHistory {
  showHistory(file?: string): void;
}
```

### Backend (Git Service)

```typescript
// Git Service
interface GitService {
  getDiff(file: string, commitA: string, commitB: string): Promise<Diff>;
  getMergeConflicts(file: string): Promise<Conflict[]>;
  resolveMergeConflict(file: string, resolution: Resolution): Promise<void>;
  getHistory(file?: string): Promise<Commit[]>;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Diff Viewer (Week 1)

1.  **Backend Git Service**: Implement a method to get the diff of a file between two commits.
2.  **Frontend Diff Viewer**: Create a side-by-side diff viewer component using Monaco Editor's diff editor.
3.  **Integration**: Integrate the diff viewer with the file explorer and the Git panel.

### Phase 2: Merge Conflict Resolution (Week 2)

1.  **Backend Git Service**: Implement methods to get and resolve merge conflicts.
2.  **Frontend Merge Conflict Resolver**: Create a UI for resolving merge conflicts, with options to accept incoming, current, or both changes.
3.  **Integration**: Integrate the merge conflict resolver with the Git panel.

### Phase 3: Git History Visualization (Week 3)

1.  **Backend Git Service**: Implement a method to get the Git history of a file or the entire repository.
2.  **Frontend Git History**: Create a visual representation of the Git history, showing commits, branches, and merges.
3.  **Integration**: Integrate the Git history view with the Git panel and the file explorer.

### Phase 4: Branch Management and Polish (Week 4)

1.  **Branch Comparison**: Add support for comparing branches and viewing the differences.
2.  **Interactive Rebase**: Implement a UI for performing interactive rebases.
3.  **UI Polish**: Refine the UI/UX of the Git features.
4.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for the advanced Git features.

## Security Considerations

-   **Command Injection**: Sanitize all input sent to Git commands to prevent command injection attacks.
-   **Authentication**: Ensure that all Git operations are properly authenticated.
-   **Data Exposure**: Be careful not to expose sensitive information from the Git repository.
