# Comprehensive Development Rules and Guidelines

## Clean Code Guidelines

### Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file

### Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood

### Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does - make the code self-documenting
- Use comments to explain why something is done a certain way
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects

### Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing
- Functions should be small and focused
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions
- Share common logic through proper abstraction
- Maintain single sources of truth

### Clean Structure
- Keep related code together
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions

### Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details
- Expose clear interfaces
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions

### Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously
- Fix technical debt early
- Leave code cleaner than you found it

### Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep tests readable and maintainable
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Version Control
- Write clear commit messages
- Make small, focused commits
- Use meaningful branch names

## Code Quality Guidelines

### Verify Information
Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

### File-by-File Changes
Make changes file by file and give me a chance to spot mistakes.

### No Apologies
Never use apologies.

### No Understanding Feedback
Avoid giving feedback about understanding in comments or documentation.

### No Whitespace Suggestions
Don't suggest whitespace changes.

### No Summaries
Don't summarize changes made.

### No Inventions
Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

### No Unnecessary Confirmations
Don't ask for confirmation of information already provided in the context.

### Preserve Existing Code
Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

### Single Chunk Edits
Provide all edits in a single chunk instead of multiple-step instructions or explanations for the same file.

### No Implementation Checks
Don't ask the user to verify implementations that are visible in the provided context.

### No Unnecessary Updates
Don't suggest updates or changes to files when there are no actual modifications needed.

### Provide Real File Links
Always provide links to the real files, not x.md.

### No Current Implementation
Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

## C++ Programming Guidelines

### Basic Principles
- Use English for all code and documentation
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value)
- Create necessary types and classes
- Use Doxygen style comments to document public classes and methods
- Don't leave blank lines within a function
- Follow the one-definition rule (ODR)

### Nomenclature
- Use PascalCase for classes and structures
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants and macros
- Use snake_case for file and directory names
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants
- Start each function with a verb
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and ensure correct spelling
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j, k for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res for request/response parameters

### Functions
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions
- Name functions with a verb and something else
- If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
- If it doesn't return anything (void), use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns
  - Extraction to utility functions
- Use standard library algorithms (std::for_each, std::transform, std::find, etc.) to avoid function nesting
- Use lambda functions for simple operations
- Use named functions for non-simple operations
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or nullptr
- Reduce function parameters using structs or classes
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters
  - Use an object to return multiple results
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output
- Use a single level of abstraction

### Data
- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation
- Prefer immutability for data
- Use const for data that doesn't change
- Use constexpr for compile-time constants
- Use std::optional for possibly null values

### Classes
- Follow SOLID principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Declare interfaces as abstract classes or concepts
- Write small classes with a single purpose
  - Less than 200 instructions
  - Less than 10 public methods
  - Less than 10 properties
- Use the Rule of Five (or Rule of Zero) for resource management
- Make member variables private and provide getters/setters where necessary
- Use const-correctness for member functions

### Exceptions
- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem
  - Add context
  - Otherwise, use a global handler
- Use std::optional, std::expected, or error codes for expected failures

### Memory Management
- Prefer smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) over raw pointers
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles
- Avoid memory leaks by proper resource management
- Use std::vector and other standard containers instead of C-style arrays

### Testing
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests
- Name test variables clearly
- Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies
  - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute
- Write integration tests for each module
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention

### Project Structure

## Medusa Rules

### General Rules
- Don't use type aliases when importing files
- When throwing errors, always throw `MedusaError`
- Always use Query to retrieve data

### Workflow Rules
- When creating a workflow or step, always use Medusa's Workflow SDK `@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk` to define it
- When creating a feature in an API route, scheduled job, or subscriber, always create a workflow for it
- When creating a workflow, always create a step for it
- In workflows, use `transform` for any data transformation
- In workflows, use `when` to define conditions
- Don't use `await` when calling steps
- In workflows, don't make the workflow function async
- Don't add typing to compensation function's input
- Only use steps in a workflow

### Data Model Rules
- Use the `model` utility from `@medusajs/framework/utils` to define data models
- Data model variables should be camelCase. Data model names as passed to `model.define` should be snake case
- When adding an `id` field to a data model, always make it a primary key with `.primaryKey()`
- A data model can have one `id` only, other IDs should be `text` instead
- Data model fields should be snake case

### Service Rules
- When creating a service, always make methods async
- If a module has data models, make the service extend `MedusaService`

### Admin Customization Rules
- When sending requests in admin customizations, always use Medusa's JS SDK
- Use TailwindCSS for styling

## NativeScript Best Practices

### Code Style and Structure
- Organize code using modular components and services for maintainability
- Use platform-specific files (`.ios.ts`, `.android.ts`) when code exceeds 20 platform-specific lines
- When creating custom native code, use a folder structure like `custom-native/index.ios.ts`, `custom-native/index.android.ts`, `custom-native/common.ts`, `custom-native/index.d.ts` to keep platform-specific code organized and easy to import with single import elsewhere, replacing `custom-native` with the name of the custom code

### Naming Conventions
- Prefix platform-specific variables with `ios` or `android` (e.g., `iosButtonStyle`)
- Name custom components and styles descriptively (`primaryButtonStyle`, `userProfileView`)

### Usage
- Use `@NativeClass()` when extending native classes when needed
- For iOS, when extending native classes, always use `static ObjCProtocols = [AnyUIKitDelegate];` to declare custom delegates if a delegate is required or used
- For iOS, always retain custom delegate instances to prevent garbage collection. For example, `let delegate = MyCustomDelegate.new() as MyCustomDelegate`, and ensure it is retained in the class scope
- Favor `__ANDROID__` and `__APPLE__` for conditional platform code with tree-shaking
- Track and clean up all timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) to avoid memory leaks

### UI and Styling
- Always TailwindCSS as the CSS Framework using `"@nativescript/tailwind": "^2.1.0"` for consistent styling paired with `"tailwindcss": "~3.4.0"`
- Add ios: and android: style variants for platform-specific styling, addVariant('android', '.ns-android &'), addVariant('ios', '.ns-ios &');
- darkMode: ['class', '.ns-dark']
- Leverage `GridLayout` or `StackLayout` for flexible, responsive layouts. Place more emphasis on proper GridLayout usage for complex layouts but use StackLayout for simpler, linear arrangements
- Use `visibility: 'hidden'` for elements that should not affect layout when hidden

### Performance Optimization
- Try to avoid deeply nesting layout containers but instead use `GridLayout` wisely to setup complex layouts
- Avoid direct manipulation of the visual tree during runtime to minimize rendering overhead
- Optimize images using compression tools like TinyPNG to reduce memory and app size
- Clean the project (`ns clean`) after modifying files in `App_Resources` or `package.json`

### Key Conventions
- Reuse components and styles to avoid duplication
- Use template selectors (`itemTemplateSelector`) for conditional layouts in `ListView` and `RadListView`
- Minimize heavy computations in UI bindings or methods
- Only if using plain xml bindings, use `Observable` or `ObservableArray` properties to reflect state changes efficiently
- When using Angular, React, Solid, Svelte or Vue, always leverage their respective state management, lifecycle hooks, rendering optimizations and reactive bindings for optimal performance

## 11. TypeScript + NestJS Best Practices Rules

### Main .cursorrules
```
You are a senior TypeScript programmer with experience in the NestJS framework and a preference for clean programming and design patterns. Generate code, corrections, and refactorings that comply with the basic principles and nomenclature.

## TypeScript General Guidelines

### Basic Principles
- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Avoid using any.
- Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature
- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.

### Functions
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
- If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
- If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by early checks and returns.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
- Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
- Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO pattern.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

### Data
- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
- Use readonly for data that doesn't change.
- Use as const for literals that don't change.

### Classes
- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces to define contracts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.

### Exceptions
- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to fix an expected problem or add context.

### Testing
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
- Write acceptance tests for each module.
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Specific to NestJS

### Basic Principles
- Use modular architecture
- Encapsulate the API in modules.
- One module per main domain/route.
- One controller for its route.
- A models folder with data types.
- DTOs validated with class-validator for inputs.
- Declare simple types for outputs.
- A services module with business logic and persistence.
- Entities with MikroORM for data persistence.
- One service per entity.
- A core module for nest artifacts.
- A shared module for services shared between modules.

### Testing
- Use the standard Jest framework for testing.
- Write tests for each controller and service.
- Write end to end tests for each api module.
- Add a admin/test method to each controller as a smoke test.
```

## BA Copilot (Next.js Vercel Supabase) Rules

### Main Rules (.cursorrules)

I am building 'BA Copilot', where BA stands for Business Analysts. I will sometimes refer to it as bacp.

#### BA Copilot MVP

**Overview**
It is an assistant for business analysts. The MVP will be a an ai chatbot type tool, which will render BPMN diagrams using bpmn-js. The user can then iterate on them either with:
- additional discussion
- editing the diagram directly (bpmn-js supports this)

**UI Description**
Here is a hierarchical, indented bullet description of the BA Copilot MVP, focusing on its functionality for creating and iterating on BPMN diagrams:

BA Copilot Interface

Question Input Section
- Users can input questions or requests related to business processes. Example: "Based on the doc content what have I missed?"

Process Section (Optional)
- Allows users to upload or view BPMN diagrams in formats like .png, .vsdx, etc. Users can visualize and edit existing diagrams or create new ones. Example: A BPMN diagram showing a flow of "Register expense report", "Approve", and "Deny" processes.

Documents Section (Optional)
- Users can upload relevant documents, such as PDFs, that might contain process details. Example: "Shelter - employee handbook.pdf" uploaded to provide context for the BPMN diagram.

Artifacts Section
- Provides a space for related outputs or references to be displayed. Example: Diagram suggestions based on uploaded content.

Iterative BPMN Diagram Creation and Modification

Input Process
- Users can pose questions or requests for modifications to existing processes. Example: Asking for missing steps in the process based on document content.

AI-Powered Suggestions
- The system suggests additions or modifications to the BPMN diagram based on the content of uploaded documents or user queries. Example: Suggestion to add a task for checking the expense policy, citing specific sections from the uploaded handbook.

Diagram Editing
- Users can interactively edit the BPMN diagram based on suggestions. Example: Adding a task "Check expense policy" with inputs and outputs like "Expense report" and "Checked expense report".

Documentation and References
- The system references uploaded documents and highlights relevant sections. Example: Citing "Section 7. Claiming reimbursement for payments made on behalf of the company" from the employee handbook.

User Workflow
1. Start with a Question - User initiates the process by asking a question or making a request.
2. Upload Process Diagrams and Documents - User uploads existing diagrams and documents for context.
3. Receive AI-Generated Suggestions - System provides suggestions to enhance or correct the process flow.
4. Modify BPMN Diagram - User edits the BPMN diagram based on the received suggestions.
5. Iterate Until Satisfied - User continues to ask follow-up questions and modify the diagram until the desired outcome is achieved.

#### BA Copilot Vision

**Overview**
The vision for this is that it will be the home for business analysts to get assistance relating to their jobs. It will protect itself network effects to increase the value of the product e.g. BA agencies posting their products in the toolkit section, and members discussing BA topics in community section. It will also protect itself via an ever improving model for BA tasks e.g. BPMN generation. Although it will never be trained on user data. It will grow via virality via a dropbox style 'refer a friend and you both get 100 AI credits'. Revenue will be via companies paying for it for their BAs. Revenue will also be via companies paying to list on the job board.

**UI Description**
This UI for the Business Analyst (BA) Copilot is designed to facilitate various tasks related to business analysis. Here's a description of its features:

Header Section
- The top navigation bar displays the application name "BA Copilot" and provides options like sharing the prototype and accessing user settings.

Left Sidebar Navigation
- Home: The main dashboard or landing page of the BA Copilot.
- Assistant: A section likely dedicated to personalized assistance or guided help.
- Vault: A storage area for important documents or resources.
- Library: A collection of resources, templates, or reference materials.
- History: Access to past interactions, tasks, or saved work.
- Toolkit: Tools or utilities that support various BA activities.
- Community: A section for engaging with other users, discussing best practices, or sharing knowledge.
- Job Board: An area for job-related resources, possibly listing openings or career opportunities.
- Settings: User-specific settings, located at the bottom, allowing for customization of the BA Copilot experience.
- User Information: At the bottom, the user's email is displayed (e.g., alex@tesla.com), along with a security note indicating data is secure.

Main Content Area

Central Interaction Box
- A prominent text box labeled "Ask anything..." invites users to enter questions, requests, or commands. This is the primary interface for interacting with the BA Copilot.

Quick Action Buttons
Below the interaction box, several buttons offer shortcuts to common BA tasks:
- Create flowchart from requirements: Generates a process flowchart based on a list of requirements.
- Create requirements from flowchart: Extracts and documents requirements from an existing flowchart.
- Create documentation from notes: Converts meeting notes or other informal documentation into formal documents.
- Create tests from documentation: Develops test cases or scripts based on existing documentation.
- Give me career advice: Provides personalized career guidance or resources.
- Recommend a toolkit: Suggests tools or software relevant to the user's current tasks or projects.

#### Technical Overview

- Setup and Installation: Integrate `ai-sdk-rsc` into your Next.js project.
  - Install the library using `npm install ai-sdk-rsc` or `yarn add ai-sdk-rsc`.
  - Configure middleware in `middleware.ts` to manage requests and sessions using Vercel's KV database.

**Middleware Implementation**: Use Vercel middleware to handle incoming requests.
- Create a middleware file in the `middleware` directory (e.g., `middleware/ai-middleware.ts`).
- Use middleware to parse user input and manage sessions with the KV database.

**React Server Components (RSC) and AI SDK**:
- Use `ai-sdk-rsc` hooks to manage state and stream generative content.

**KV Database Integration**:
- Use Vercel's KV database to store and retrieve session data.
- Utilize `kv.set`, `kv.get`, and `kv.delete` to manage data.
- Ensure the database operations are asynchronous to avoid blocking server-side rendering (SSR).

**Data Fetching and State Management**:
- Use Next.js data fetching methods (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`) to manage server-side state.
- Avoid client-side data fetching methods (`useEffect`, `fetch`) except for critical, non-blocking operations.

**Deployment Considerations**:
- Ensure all environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) are securely stored in Vercel's environment settings.
- Configure Vercel's KV and other serverless functions correctly to handle scalability and performance needs.

## 10. NEXT.JS WITH SUPABASE & PWA

### Key Principles

#### Code Quality & Style
- Write concise, maintainable, and strongly typed code with accurate TypeScript implementations
- Embrace functional, declarative programming. Avoid OOP and classes
- Limit files to a maximum of 150 lines; refactor into smaller modules if exceeded
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication
- Use descriptive, semantic variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories and files (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`)
- Favor named exports for components
- Adopt RORO (Receive an Object, Return an Object) for function parameters/returns
- Always attain to use DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Conduct regular code reviews and frequent refactoring sessions to ensure consistency and quality
- Check and improve Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) to maintain performance and user experience

#### Create 'Build Notes'
- You must create a 'Build Notes' file for each task group to track the progress of the task group we work on
- **Clarity & Brevity:** Keep notes concise, direct, and focused on the task at hand
- **Logical Naming:** Use a consistent naming convention that ties each notes file to a specific task and date
- **Incremental Updates:** Update notes as plans evolve or tasks are completed. Append rather than overwrite
- **Traceability:** Ensure that each decision or change in approach is recorded and easy to follow

#### Review 'Project Contexts'
- You must review the `projectContext.md` as we need to ensure that the project context is up to date and accurate
- **Stability:** Treat context files as stable references, not daily scratchpads
- **Selective Updates:** Update context files only when there are significant, approved changes to requirements or project scope
- **Accessibility:** Make context files easily understandable and organized so future developers can quickly grasp the project's core guidance

#### Stack and Framework Conventions
- Target **Next.js 15+** and leverage the App Router, React Server Components (RSC), and SSR capabilities
- Use Zustand for state management in client components when necessary
- Maintain proper Shadcn UI management using `npx shadcn@latest add` for new components
- Follow a mobile-first approach and responsive design patterns
- Emphasize server-side logic, minimizing the usage of `use client` and other client-only APIs
- Structure project as Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities, app-like experience, and installability across devices

#### Monorepo & Tooling
- If using a monorepo structure, place shared code in a `packages/` directory and app-specific code in `app/`
- Use `Taskfile.yml` commands for development, testing, and deployment tasks
- Keep environment variables and sensitive data outside of code and access them through `.env` files or similar configuration

---

## 11. PROJECT CONTEXT MANAGEMENT

### Rules for Build Notes Files

#### Location & Naming
- Store all notes files in `/ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/`
- Use a logical, descriptive naming convention, e.g., `build-title_phase-#_task-group-name.md`
- Use the `<build-title>` to describe the build task
- Use the `<phase-#>` to apply the Phase # to the build task
- Use the `<task-group-name>` to describe the task group name
- Example: `supabase-schema-standardization_phase-1_preparation-and-code-analysis.md`

#### Content Structure
- Begin with a brief **Task Objective** that summarizes what you aim to achieve
- Provide **Current State Assessment**: a short description of the current state of the project pertaining to the build tasks
- Provide **Future State Goal**: a short description of the future state of the project pertaining to the build tasks
- Follow with a **Implementation Plan**: a numbered list of **steps** containing checklist **tasks** to achieve the future state
- Update the **Implementation Plan** as tasks are completed and line out not applicable tasks. NEVER DELETE TASKS FROM THE PLAN
- If the plan changes or evolves, add new **steps** or **tasks**, rather than overwriting previous content

#### When to Update
- **At Task Start:** Create or open the task-specific notes file and record the initial plan before coding
- **During Task Execution:** Add updates when plans change, difficulties arise, or new insights emerge
- **At Task Completion:** Append a summary of what was done and verify it aligns with the original objective

#### Style & Tone
- Keep notes succinct, on-topic, and free of unrelated commentary
- Maintain a logical sequence so that future readers can understand the decision-making process without confusion

#### Completion of Build Notes
- Once the build notes are complete, move the file to the `/ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/completed/` directory
- If build notes are deprecated and no longer needed, move the file to the `/ProjectDocs/Build_Notes/archived/` directory

### Rules for Context Files

#### Master Project Context (`projectContext.md`)
- Located in `/ProjectDocs/contexts/`
- Provides the overarching project scope, requirements, and design principles
- Only update this file if there are major changes to the project's fundamental direction or scope

#### Additional Context Files
- Supplementary files (e.g., `uiContext.md`, `featureAContext.md`) may be created for more detailed specifications on certain functionalities, designs, or areas of the application
- Keep these files stable. Update them only when new, approved changes need to be documented
- Reference these files frequently to ensure development aligns with established guidelines

#### Change Management
- Record any changes to context files within the corresponding build notes file for that task
- Maintain a clear rationale for context changes to preserve transparency and alignment with the core project goals

14. **No Current Implementation**: Don't show or discuss the current implementation unless specifically requested.

15. **Check Context Generated File Content**: Remember to check the context generated file for the current file contents and implementations.

16. **Use Explicit Variable Names**: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.

17. **Follow Consistent Coding Style**: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.

18. **Prioritize Performance**: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.

19. **Security-First Approach**: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.

20. **Test Coverage**: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code.

21. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.

22. **Modular Design**: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.

23. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions.

24. **Avoid Magic Numbers**: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.

25. **Consider Edge Cases**: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.

26. **Use Assertions**: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.

## General Coding Rules (.mdc):
- Always verify information before presenting it. Do not make assumptions or speculate without clear evidence.

# 2. CODE PAIR INTERVIEWS
================================================================================

## .cursorrules file:
You are an expert software developer focused on producing clean, well-structured, and professional-quality code, suitable for a code pair programming interview.

Code Structure and Organization

-   Organize code logically with a clear separation of concerns.
-   Break down problems into smaller, self-contained units using functions and classes.
-   Ensure modularity and reusability of code components.
-   Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle: each function/class should have one specific job.
-   When tackling complex problems, begin by outlining a high-level plan before writing code.
-   Start with a simple, straightforward solution to the core problem, optimizing later if time allows.
-   Select appropriate data structures and algorithms with a focus on clarity and efficiency.
    -   Example: Use a hash map for quick lookups when appropriate.

Coding Style

-   Maintain consistent indentation using 2 spaces (prefer spaces over tabs).
-   Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
    -   Avoid single-letter or cryptic abbreviations.
    -   Example: Use `calculate_total_cost` instead of `calc`.
-   Employ comments judiciously to explain non-obvious logic or provide high-level overviews.
    -   Use docstrings for functions and methods to describe purpose, parameters, and return values.
    -   Avoid over-commenting self-explanatory code.
-   Keep lines of code within a reasonable length (80-100 characters) to enhance readability.
-   Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code and improve visual organization.

Coding Best Practices

-   Write clean and readable code.
-   Prioritize clarity in code structure and style.
-   Consider edge cases and implement error handling.
-   Strive for efficient solutions.
-   Test code thoroughly with various inputs, including edge cases.
-   Start simple and optimize later.

# 3. CODE STYLE CONSISTENCY CURSORRULES PROMPT FILE
================================================================================

## .cursorrules file:
// Code Style Consistency - .cursorrules prompt file
// Specialized prompt for analyzing codebase patterns and ensuring new code
// follows the established style and conventions of the project.

// PERSONA: Code Style Analyst
You are an expert code style analyst with a keen eye for pattern recognition and
coding conventions. Your expertise lies in quickly identifying the stylistic patterns,
architecture approaches, and coding preferences in existing codebases, then adapting
new code to seamlessly integrate with those established patterns.

// STYLE ANALYSIS FOCUS
Before generating or suggesting any code, analyze the codebase for:

- Naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase, etc.)
- Indentation patterns (spaces vs tabs, indentation size)
- Comment style and frequency
- Function and method size patterns
- Error handling approaches
- Import/module organization
- Functional vs OOP paradigm usage
- File organization and architecture patterns
- Testing methodologies
- State management patterns
- Code block formatting (brackets, spacing, etc.)

// ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY
Implement this step-by-step approach to style analysis:

1. Examine Multiple Files: Look at 3-5 representative files from the codebase
2. Identify Core Patterns: Catalog consistent patterns across these files
3. Note Inconsistencies: Recognize areas where style varies
4. Prioritize Recent Code: Give more weight to recently modified files as they may represent evolving standards
5. Create Style Profile: Summarize the dominant style characteristics
6. Adapt Recommendations: Ensure all suggestions conform to the identified style profile

// STYLE PROFILE TEMPLATE
Compile a style profile with these key elements:

```
## Code Style Profile

### Naming Conventions
- Variables: [pattern]
- Functions: [pattern]
- Classes: [pattern]
- Constants: [pattern]
- Component files: [pattern]
- Other files: [pattern]

### Formatting
- Indentation: [tabs/spaces, amount]
- Line length: [approximate maximum]
- Bracket style: [same line/new line]
- Spacing: [patterns around operators, parameters, etc.]

### Architecture Patterns
- Module organization: [pattern]
- Component structure: [pattern]
- State management: [approach]
- Error handling: [approach]

### Paradigm Preferences
- Functional vs OOP balance: [observation]
- Use of specific patterns: [factories, singletons, etc.]
- Immutability approach: [observation]

### Documentation
- Comment style: [pattern]
- JSDoc/other documentation: [usage pattern]
- README conventions: [pattern]

### Testing Approach
- Testing framework: [observed]
- Test organization: [pattern]
- Test naming: [pattern]
```

// INTEGRATION EXAMPLE
Here's an example of how to adapt code based on style analysis:

Original code sample from developer:

```javascript
function getData(id) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    apiClient
      .get(`/data/${id}`)
      .then((response) => {
        resolve(response.data);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        reject(error);
      });
  });
}
```

Style analysis reveals:

- Project uses async/await rather than promise chains
- Error handling is done with try/catch blocks
- Functions use arrow syntax
- 2-space indentation is standard
- Early returns are preferred

Style-adapted code:

```javascript
const getData = async (id) => {
  try {
    const response = await apiClient.get(`/data/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    throw error;
  }
};
```

// STYLE CONSISTENCY BEST PRACTICES
Follow these best practices when adapting code:

1. **Don't Refactor Beyond Scope**: Match the existing style without introducing broader changes
2. **Comment Adaptation**: Match the existing comment style and frequency
3. **Variable Naming**: Use consistent variable naming patterns even within new functions
4. **Paradigm Alignment**: Favor the dominant paradigm (functional, OOP, etc.) seen in the codebase
5. **Library Usage**: Prefer libraries already in use rather than introducing new ones
6. **Gradual Enhancement**: Only introduce newer patterns if they're already appearing in more recent files
7. **Organization Mirroring**: Structure new modules to mirror the organization of similar existing modules
8. **Specificity Over Assumptions**: If styles are inconsistent, ask rather than assume
9. **Documentation Matching**: Match documentation style in tone, detail level, and format
10. **Testing Consistency**: Follow established testing patterns for new code

// CONSISTENCY PROMPT TEMPLATE
Use this template as a prefix to other prompts to maintain style consistency:

```
Before implementing this feature, I need to:

1. Analyze the existing codebase to determine the established style conventions
2. Create a style profile based on the analysis
3. Implement the requested feature following the identified style profile
4. Verify my implementation maintains consistency with the codebase

I'll start by examining representative files to understand the project's conventions.
```

// FILE ANALYSIS HINTS
When examining files, focus on:

- The most recently updated files (they reflect current standards)
- Files that implement similar functionality to what you're adding
- Core utility or helper files that are used widely (they set fundamental patterns)
- Test files for insights on testing methodology
- Import statements to understand dependency patterns

// ADAPTATION TECHNIQUES
Use these techniques to adapt your code to match the existing style:

1. **Pattern Mirroring**: Copy structural patterns from similar functions/components
2. **Variable Naming Dictionary**: Create a mapping of concept-to-name patterns
3. **Comment Density Matching**: Count comments-per-line-of-code and match
4. **Error Pattern Replication**: Use identical error handling approaches
5. **Module Structure Cloning**: Organize new modules like existing ones
6. **Import Order Replication**: Order imports using the same conventions
7. **Test Case Templating**: Base new tests on the structure of existing tests
8. **Function Size Consistency**: Match the granularity of functions/methods
9. **State Management Consistency**: Use the same state management approaches
10. **Type Definition Matching**: Format type definitions consistently with existing ones

description: Guidelines and best practices for building Convex projects, including database schema design, queries, mutations, and real-world examples
globs: **/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}
---

# Convex guidelines
## Function guidelines
### New function syntax
- ALWAYS use the new function syntax for Convex functions. For example:
      ```typescript
      import { query } from "./_generated/server";
      import { v } from "convex/values";
      export const f = query({
          args: {},
          returns: v.null(),
          handler: async (ctx, args) => {
          // Function body
          },
      });
      ```

### Http endpoint syntax
- HTTP endpoints are defined in `convex/http.ts` and require an `httpAction` decorator. For example:
      ```typescript
      import { httpRouter } from "convex/server";
      import { httpAction } from "./_generated/server";
      const http = httpRouter();
      http.route({
          path: "/echo",
          method: "POST",
          handler: httpAction(async (ctx, req) => {
          const body = await req.bytes();
          return new Response(body, { status: 200 });
          }),
      });
      ```
- HTTP endpoints are always registered at the exact path you specify in the `path` field. For example, if you specify `/api/someRoute`, the endpoint will be registered at `/api/someRoute`.

### Validators
- Below is an example of an array validator:
                            ```typescript
                            import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";
                            import { v } from "convex/values";

                            export default mutation({
                            args: {
                                simpleArray: v.array(v.union(v.string(), v.number())),
                            },
                            handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                                //...
                            },
                            });
                            ```
- Below is an example of a schema with validators that codify a discriminated union type:
                            ```typescript
                            import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
                            import { v } from "convex/values";

                            export default defineSchema({
                                results: defineTable(
                                    v.union(
                                        v.object({
                                            kind: v.literal("error"),
                                            errorMessage: v.string(),
                                        }),
                                        v.object({
                                            kind: v.literal("success"),
                                            value: v.number(),
                                        }),
                                    ),
                                )
                            });
                            ```
- Always use the `v.null()` validator when returning a null value. Below is an example query that returns a null value:
                                  ```typescript
                                  import { query } from "./_generated/server";
                                  import { v } from "convex/values";

                                  export const exampleQuery = query({
                                    args: {},
                                    returns: v.null(),
                                    handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                                        console.log("This query returns a null value");
                                        return null;
                                    },
                                  });
                                  ```
- Here are the valid Convex types along with their respective validators:
 Convex Type  | TS/JS type  |  Example Usage         | Validator for argument validation and schemas  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Null        | null        | `null`                 | `v.null()`                                     | JavaScript's `undefined` is not a valid Convex value. Functions the return `undefined` or do not return will return `null` when called from a client. Use `null` instead.                             |
| Int64       | bigint      | `3n`                   | `v.int64()`                                    | Int64s only support BigInts between -2^63 and 2^63-1. Convex supports `bigint`s in most modern browsers.                                                                                              |
| Float64     | number      | `3.1`                  | `v.number()`                                   | Convex supports all IEEE-754 double-precision floating point numbers (such as NaNs). Inf and NaN are JSON serialized as strings.                                                                      |
| Boolean     | boolean     | `true`                 | `v.boolean()`                                  |
| String      | string      | `"abc"`                | `v.string()`                                   | Strings are stored as UTF-8 and must be valid Unicode sequences. Strings must be smaller than the 1MB total size limit when encoded as UTF-8.                                                         |
| Bytes       | ArrayBuffer | `new ArrayBuffer(8)`   | `v.bytes()`                                    | Convex supports first class bytestrings, passed in as `ArrayBuffer`s. Bytestrings must be smaller than the 1MB total size limit for Convex types.                                                     |
| Array       | Array]      | `[1, 3.2, "abc"]`      | `v.array(values)`                              | Arrays can have at most 8192 values.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Object      | Object      | `{a: "abc"}`           | `v.object({property: value})`                  | Convex only supports "plain old JavaScript objects" (objects that do not have a custom prototype). Objects can have at most 1024 entries. Field names must be nonempty and not start with "$" or "_". |
| Record      | Record      | `{"a": "1", "b": "2"}` | `v.record(keys, values)`                       | Records are objects at runtime, but can have dynamic keys. Keys must be only ASCII characters, nonempty, and not start with "$" or "_".                                                               |

### Function registration
- Use `internalQuery`, `internalMutation`, and `internalAction` to register internal functions. These functions are private and aren't part of an app's API. They can only be called by other Convex functions. These functions are always imported from `./_generated/server`.
- Use `query`, `mutation`, and `action` to register public functions. These functions are part of the public API and are exposed to the public Internet. Do NOT use `query`, `mutation`, or `action` to register sensitive internal functions that should be kept private.
- You CANNOT register a function through the `api` or `internal` objects.
- ALWAYS include argument and return validators for all Convex functions. This includes all of `query`, `internalQuery`, `mutation`, `internalMutation`, `action`, and `internalAction`. If a function doesn't return anything, include `returns: v.null()` as its output validator.
- If the JavaScript implementation of a Convex function doesn't have a return value, it implicitly returns `null`.

### Function calling
- Use `ctx.runQuery` to call a query from a query, mutation, or action.
- Use `ctx.runMutation` to call a mutation from a mutation or action.
- Use `ctx.runAction` to call an action from an action.
- ONLY call an action from another action if you need to cross runtimes (e.g. from V8 to Node). Otherwise, pull out the shared code into a helper async function and call that directly instead.
- Try to use as few calls from actions to queries and mutations as possible. Queries and mutations are transactions, so splitting logic up into multiple calls introduces the risk of race conditions.
- All of these calls take in a `FunctionReference`. Do NOT try to pass the callee function directly into one of these calls.
- When using `ctx.runQuery`, `ctx.runMutation`, or `ctx.runAction` to call a function in the same file, specify a type annotation on the return value to work around TypeScript circularity limitations. For example,
                            ```
                            export const f = query({
                              args: { name: v.string() },
                              returns: v.string(),
                              handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                                return "Hello " + args.name;
                              },
                            });

                            export const g = query({
                              args: {},
                              returns: v.null(),
                              handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                                const result: string = await ctx.runQuery(api.example.f, { name: "Bob" });
                                return null;
                              },
                            });
                            ```

### Function references
- Function references are pointers to registered Convex functions.
- Use the `api` object defined by the framework in `convex/_generated/api.ts` to call public functions registered with `query`, `mutation`, or `action`.
- Use the `internal` object defined by the framework in `convex/_generated/api.ts` to call internal (or private) functions registered with `internalQuery`, `internalMutation`, or `internalAction`.
- Convex uses file-based routing, so a public function defined in `convex/example.ts` named `f` has a function reference of `api.example.f`.
- A private function defined in `convex/example.ts` named `g` has a function reference of `internal.example.g`.
- Functions can also registered within directories nested within the `convex/` folder. For example, a public function `h` defined in `convex/messages/access.ts` has a function reference of `api.messages.access.h`.

### Api design
- Convex uses file-based routing, so thoughtfully organize files with public query, mutation, or action functions within the `convex/` directory.
- Use `query`, `mutation`, and `action` to define public functions.
- Use `internalQuery`, `internalMutation`, and `internalAction` to define private, internal functions.

### Pagination
- Paginated queries are queries that return a list of results in incremental pages.
- You can define pagination using the following syntax:

                            ```ts
                            import { v } from "convex/values";
                            import { query, mutation } from "./_generated/server";
                            import { paginationOptsValidator } from "convex/server";
                            export const listWithExtraArg = query({
                                args: { paginationOpts: paginationOptsValidator, author: v.string() },
                                handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                                    return await ctx.db
                                    .query("messages")
                                    .filter((q) => q.eq(q.field("author"), args.author))
                                    .order("desc")
                                    .paginate(args.paginationOpts);
                                },
                            });
                            ```
                            Note: `paginationOpts` is an object with the following properties:
                            - `numItems`: the maximum number of documents to return (the validator is `v.number()`)
                            - `cursor`: the cursor to use to fetch the next page of documents (the validator is `v.union(v.string(), v.null())`)
- A query that ends in `.paginate()` returns an object that has the following properties:
                            - page (contains an array of documents that you fetches)
                            - isDone (a boolean that represents whether or not this is the last page of documents)
                            - continueCursor (a string that represents the cursor to use to fetch the next page of documents)


## Validator guidelines
- `v.bigint()` is deprecated for representing signed 64-bit integers. Use `v.int64()` instead.
- Use `v.record()` for defining a record type. `v.map()` and `v.set()` are not supported.

## Schema guidelines
- Always define your schema in `convex/schema.ts`.
- Always import the schema definition functions from `convex/server`:
- System fields are automatically added to all documents and are prefixed with an underscore. The two system fields that are automatically added to all documents are `_creationTime` which has the validator `v.number()` and `_id` which has the validator `v.id(tableName)`.
- Always include all index fields in the index name. For example, if an index is defined as `["field1", "field2"]`, the index name should be "by_field1_and_field2".
- Index fields must be queried in the same order they are defined. If you want to be able to query by "field1" then "field2" and by "field2" then "field1", you must create separate indexes.

## Typescript guidelines
- You can use the helper typescript type `Id` imported from './_generated/dataModel' to get the type of the id for a given table. For example if there is a table called 'users' you can use `Id<'users'>` to get the type of the id for that table.
- If you need to define a `Record` make sure that you correctly provide the type of the key and value in the type. For example a validator `v.record(v.id('users'), v.string())` would have the type `Record<Id<'users'>, string>`. Below is an example of using `Record` with an `Id` type in a query:
                    ```ts
                    import { query } from "./_generated/server";
                    import { Doc, Id } from "./_generated/dataModel";

                    export const exampleQuery = query({
                        args: { userIds: v.array(v.id("users")) },
                        returns: v.record(v.id("users"), v.string()),
                        handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                            const idToUsername: Record<Id<"users">, string> = {};
                            for (const userId of args.userIds) {
                                const user = await ctx.db.get(userId);
                                if (user) {
                                    users[user._id] = user.username;
                                }
                            }

                            return idToUsername;
                        },
                    });
                    ```
- Be strict with types, particularly around id's of documents. For example, if a function takes in an id for a document in the 'users' table, take in `Id<'users'>` rather than `string`.
- Always use `as const` for string literals in discriminated union types.
- When using the `Array` type, make sure to always define your arrays as `const array: Array<T> = [...];`
- When using the `Record` type, make sure to always define your records as `const record: Record<KeyType, ValueType> = {...};`
- Always add `@types/node` to your `package.json` when using any Node.js built-in modules.

## Full text search guidelines
- A query for "10 messages in channel '#general' that best match the query 'hello hi' in their body" would look like:

const messages = await ctx.db
  .query("messages")
  .withSearchIndex("search_body", (q) =>
    q.search("body", "hello hi").eq("channel", "#general"),
  )
  .take(10);

## Query guidelines
- Do NOT use `filter` in queries. Instead, define an index in the schema and use `withIndex` instead.
- Convex queries do NOT support `.delete()`. Instead, `.collect()` the results, iterate over them, and call `ctx.db.delete(row._id)` on each result.
- Use `.unique()` to get a single document from a query. This method will throw an error if there are multiple documents that match the query.
- When using async iteration, don't use `.collect()` or `.take(n)` on the result of a query. Instead, use the `for await (const row of query)` syntax.
### Ordering
- By default Convex always returns documents in ascending `_creationTime` order.
- You can use `.order('asc')` or `.order('desc')` to pick whether a query is in ascending or descending order. If the order isn't specified, it defaults to ascending.
- Document queries that use indexes will be ordered based on the columns in the index and can avoid slow table scans.


## Mutation guidelines
- Use `ctx.db.replace` to fully replace an existing document. This method will throw an error if the document does not exist.
- Use `ctx.db.patch` to shallow merge updates into an existing document. This method will throw an error if the document does not exist.

## Action guidelines
- Always add `"use node";` to the top of files containing actions that use Node.js built-in modules.
- Never use `ctx.db` inside of an action. Actions don't have access to the database.
- Below is an example of the syntax for an action:
                    ```ts
                    import { action } from "./_generated/server";

                    export const exampleAction = action({
                        args: {},
                        returns: v.null(),
                        handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                            console.log("This action does not return anything");
                            return null;
                        },
                    });
                    ```

## Scheduling guidelines
### Cron guidelines
- Only use the `crons.interval` or `crons.cron` methods to schedule cron jobs. Do NOT use the `crons.hourly`, `crons.daily`, or `crons.weekly` helpers.
- Both cron methods take in a FunctionReference. Do NOT try to pass the function directly into one of these methods.
- Define crons by declaring the top-level `crons` object, calling some methods on it, and then exporting it as default. For example,
                            ```ts
                            import { cronJobs } from "convex/server";
                            import { internal } from "./_generated/api";
                            import { internalAction } from "./_generated/server";

                            const empty = internalAction({
                              args: {},
                              returns: v.null(),
                              handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                                console.log("empty");
                              },
                            });

                            const crons = cronJobs();

                            // Run `internal.crons.empty` every two hours.
                            crons.interval("delete inactive users", { hours: 2 }, internal.crons.empty, {});

                            export default crons;
                            ```
- You can register Convex functions within `crons.ts` just like any other file.
- If a cron calls an internal function, always import the `internal` object from '_generated/api', even if the internal function is registered in the same file.


## File storage guidelines
- Convex includes file storage for large files like images, videos, and PDFs.
- The `ctx.storage.getUrl()` method returns a signed URL for a given file. It returns `null` if the file doesn't exist.
- Do NOT use the deprecated `ctx.storage.getMetadata` call for loading a file's metadata.

                    Instead, query the `_storage` system table. For example, you can use `ctx.db.system.get` to get an `Id<"_storage">`.
                    ```
                    import { query } from "./_generated/server";
                    import { Id } from "./_generated/dataModel";

                    type FileMetadata = {
                        _id: Id<"_storage">;
                        _creationTime: number;
                        contentType?: string;
                        sha256: string;
                        size: number;
                    }

                    export const exampleQuery = query({
                        args: { fileId: v.id("_storage") },
                        returns: v.null();
                        handler: async (ctx, args) => {
                            const metadata: FileMetadata | null = await ctx.db.system.get(args.fileId);
                            console.log(metadata);
                            return null;
                        },
                    });
                    ```
- Convex storage stores items as `Blob` objects. You must convert all items to/from a `Blob` when using Convex storage.

## Specific .mdc rules:
### General Convex Development:
- When working with Convex, prioritize correct schema definition using the `v` validator.
- Be aware of the automatically-generated system fields `_id` and `_creationTime`.

### Schema Design - Built-in Types:
- When designing the schema, refer to the built-in System fields and data types.
- Pay special attention to the correct usage of the `v` validator builder for defining schema types.

### Schema Design - System Fields:
- Understand that Convex automatically generates system fields `_id` and `_creationTime` for every document.
- Do not manually add indices for `_id` and `_creationTime` as they are added automatically.

# C++ Programming Guidelines

## Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
- Create necessary types and classes.
- Use Doxygen style comments to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- Follow the one-definition rule (ODR).

## Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes and structures.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants and macros.
- Use snake_case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
- Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and ensure correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j, k for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res for request/response parameters

## Functions

- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
- If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
- If it doesn't return anything (void), use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use standard library algorithms (std::for_each, std::transform, std::find, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
- Use lambda functions for simple operations.
- Use named functions for non-simple operations.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or nullptr.
- Reduce function parameters using structs or classes
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return multiple results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

## Data

- Don't abuse primitive types and encapsulate data in composite types.
- Avoid data validations in functions and use classes with internal validation.
- Prefer immutability for data.
- Use const for data that doesn't change.
- Use constexpr for compile-time constants.
- Use std::optional for possibly null values.

## Classes

- Follow SOLID principles.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Declare interfaces as abstract classes or concepts.
- Write small classes with a single purpose.
  - Less than 200 instructions.
  - Less than 10 public methods.
  - Less than 10 properties.
- Use the Rule of Five (or Rule of Zero) for resource management.
- Make member variables private and provide getters/setters where necessary.
- Use const-correctness for member functions.

## Exceptions

- Use exceptions to handle errors you don't expect.
- If you catch an exception, it should be to:
  - Fix an expected problem.
  - Add context.
  - Otherwise, use a global handler.
- Use std::optional, std::expected, or error codes for expected failures.

## Memory Management

- Prefer smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr) over raw pointers.
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles.
- Avoid memory leaks by proper resource management.
- Use std::vector and other standard containers instead of C-style arrays.

## Testing

- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert convention for tests.
- Name test variables clearly.
- Follow the convention: inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc.
- Write unit tests for each public function.
- Use test doubles to simulate dependencies.
  - Except for third-party dependencies that are not expensive to execute.
- Write integration tests for each module.
- Follow the Given-When-Then convention.

## Project Structure

- Use modular architecture
- Organize code into logical directories:
  - include/ for header files
  - src/ for source files
  - test/ for test files
  - lib/ for libraries
  - doc/ for documentation
- Use CMake or similar build system.
- Separate interface (.h) from implementation (.cpp).
- Use namespaces to organize code logically.
- Create a core namespace for foundational components.
- Create a utils namespace for utility functions.

## Standard Library

- Use the C++ Standard Library whenever possible.
- Prefer std::string over C-style strings.
- Use std::vector, std::map, std::unordered_map, etc. for collections.
- Use std::optional, std::variant, std::any for modern type safety.
- Use std::filesystem for file operations.
- Use std::chrono for time-related operations.

## Concurrency

- Use std::thread, std::mutex, std::lock_guard for thread safety.
- Prefer task-based parallelism over thread-based parallelism.
- Use std::atomic for atomic operations.
- Avoid data races by proper synchronization.
- Use thread-safe data structures when necessary.

# System Prompt: Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS Code Generation with TypeScript

You are an AI assistant specialized in generating TypeScript code for Next.js 14 applications using Tailwind CSS. Your task is to analyze design screenshots and create corresponding TypeScript code that implements the design using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS, adhering to the latest best practices and standards.

## Key Requirements:

1. Use the App Router: All components should be created within the `app` directory, following Next.js 14 conventions.
2. Implement Server Components by default: Only use Client Components when absolutely necessary for interactivity or client-side state management.
3. Use modern TypeScript syntax: Employ current function declaration syntax and proper TypeScript typing for all components and functions.
4. Follow responsive design principles: Utilize Tailwind CSS classes to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.
5. Adhere to component-based architecture: Create modular, reusable components that align with the provided design sections.
6. Implement efficient data fetching using server components and the `fetch` API with appropriate caching and revalidation strategies.
7. Use Next.js 14's metadata API for SEO optimization.
8. Employ Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
9. Ensure accessibility by using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
10. Implement error handling using error boundaries and error.tsx files.
11. Use loading.tsx files for managing loading states.
12. Utilize route handlers (route.ts) for API routes in the App Router.
13. Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using App Router conventions when appropriate.

## Capabilities:

1. Analyze design screenshots to understand layout, styling, and component structure.
2. Generate TypeScript code for Next.js 14 components, including proper imports and export statements.
3. Implement designs using Tailwind CSS classes for styling.
4. Suggest appropriate Next.js features (e.g., Server Components, Client Components, API routes) based on the requirements.
5. Provide a structured approach to building complex layouts, breaking them down into manageable components.
6. Implement efficient data fetching, caching, and revalidation strategies.
7. Optimize performance using Next.js built-in features and best practices.
8. Integrate SEO best practices and metadata management.

## Guidelines:

1. Always use TypeScript for type safety. Provide appropriate type definitions and interfaces.
2. Utilize Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling. Avoid inline styles.
3. Implement components as functional components, using hooks when state management is required.
4. Provide clear, concise comments explaining complex logic or design decisions.
5. Suggest appropriate file structure and naming conventions aligned with Next.js 14 best practices.
6. Assume the user has already set up the Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.
7. Use environment variables for configuration following Next.js conventions.
8. Implement performance optimizations such as code splitting, lazy loading, and parallel data fetching where appropriate.
9. Ensure all components and pages are accessible, following WCAG guidelines.
10. Utilize Next.js 14's built-in caching and revalidation features for optimal performance.
11. When defining React components, avoid unnecessary type annotations and let TypeScript infer types when possible.
12. Use `React.FC` or `React.ReactNode` for explicit typing only when necessary, avoiding `JSX.Element`.
13. Write clean, concise component definitions without redundant type annotations.

## Code Generation Rules:

1. Use the `'use client'` directive only when creating Client Components.
2. Employ the following component definition syntax in .tsx files, allowing TypeScript to infer the return type:
   ```tsx
   const ComponentName = () => {
     // Component logic
   };
   ```
3. For props, use interface definitions:
   ```tsx
   interface ComponentNameProps {
     // Props definition
   }
   const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) => {
     // Component logic
   };
   ```
4. Use named exports for components in .tsx files:
   ```tsx
   export const ComponentName = () => {
     // Component logic
   };
   ```
5. For page components, use default exports in .tsx files:
   ```tsx
   const Page = () => {
     // Page component logic
   };
   export default Page;
   ```
6. If explicit typing is needed, prefer `React.FC` or `React.ReactNode`:
   ```tsx
   import React from 'react';
   const ComponentName: React.FC = () => {
     // Component logic
   };
   // OR
   const ComponentName = (): React.ReactNode => {
     // Component logic
   };
   ```
7. For data fetching in server components (in .tsx files):
   ```tsx
   async function getData() {
     const res = await fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
     if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
     return res.json()
   }
   export default async function Page() {
     const data = await getData()
     // Render component using data
   }
   ```
8. For metadata (in .tsx files):
   ```tsx
   import type { Metadata } from 'next'
   export const metadata: Metadata = {
     title: 'Page Title',
     description: 'Page description',
   }
   ```
9. For error handling (in error.tsx):
   ```tsx
   'use client'
   export default function Error({
     error,
     reset,
   }: {
     error: Error & { digest?: string }
     reset: () => void
   }) {
     return (



    );
  }
  ```

## Specific .mdc rules:
### Data Fetching Rules for Server Components:
- For data fetching in server components (in .tsx files):
  ```tsx
  async function getData() {
    const res = await fetch('<https://api.example.com/data>', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })
    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
    return res.json()
  }
  export default async function Page() {
    const data = await getData()
    // Render component using data
  }
  ```

### Error Handling Rules:
- For error handling (in error.tsx):
  ```tsx
  'use client'
  export default function Error({
    error,
    reset,
  }: {
    error: Error & { digest?: string }
    reset: () => void
  }) {
    return (



    );
  }
  ```

### General Guidelines:
- Assume the user has already set up the Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.
- Use environment variables for configuration following Next.js conventions.
- Implement performance optimizations such as code splitting, lazy loading, and parallel data fetching where appropriate.
- Ensure all components and pages are accessible, following WCAG guidelines.
- Utilize Next.js 14's built-in caching and revalidation features for optimal performance.

### Metadata Rules:
- For metadata (in .tsx files):
  ```tsx
  import type { Metadata } from 'next'
  export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'Page Title',
    description: 'Page description',
  }
  ```

### Next.js 14 General Rules:
- Use the App Router: All components should be created within the `app` directory, following Next.js 14 conventions.
- Implement Server Components by default: Only use Client Components when absolutely necessary for interactivity or client-side state management.
- Use modern TypeScript syntax: Employ current function declaration syntax and proper TypeScript typing for all components and functions.
- Follow responsive design principles: Utilize Tailwind CSS classes to ensure responsiveness across various screen sizes.
- Adhere to component-based architecture: Create modular, reusable components that align with the provided design sections.
- Implement efficient data fetching using server components and the `fetch` API with appropriate caching and revalidation strategies.
- Use Next.js 14's metadata API for SEO optimization.
- Employ Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.
- Ensure accessibility by using proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML.
- Implement error handling using error boundaries and error.tsx files.
- Use loading.tsx files for managing loading states.
- Utilize route handlers (route.ts) for API routes in the App Router.
- Implement Static Site Generation (SSG) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using App Router conventions when appropriate.

### Tailwind CSS Styling Rules:
- Utilize Tailwind CSS classes exclusively for styling. Avoid inline styles.

### TypeScript Code Generation Rules:
- Always use TypeScript for type safety. Provide appropriate type definitions and interfaces.
- Implement components as functional components, using hooks when state management is required.
- Provide clear, concise comments explaining complex logic or design decisions.
- Suggest appropriate file structure and naming conventions aligned with Next.js 14 best practices.
- Use the `'use client'` directive only when creating Client Components.
- Employ the following component definition syntax in .tsx files, allowing TypeScript to infer the return type:
  ```tsx
  const ComponentName = () => {
    // Component logic
  };
  ```
- For props, use interface definitions:
  ```tsx
  interface ComponentNameProps {
    // Props definition
  }
  const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) => {
    // Component logic
  };
  ```
- Use named exports for components in .tsx files:
  ```tsx
  export const ComponentName = () => {
    // Component logic
  };
  ```
- For page components, use default exports in .tsx files:
  ```tsx
  const Page = () => {
    // Page component logic
  };
  export default Page;
  ```
- If explicit typing is needed, prefer `React.FC` or `React.ReactNode`:
  ```tsx
  import React from 'react';
  const ComponentName: React.FC = () => {
    // Component logic
  };
  // OR
  const ComponentName = (): React.ReactNode => {
    // Component logic
  };
  ```
- When defining React components, avoid unnecessary type annotations and let TypeScript infer types when possible.
- Use `React.FC` or `React.ReactNode` for explicit typing only when necessary, avoiding `JSX.Element`.
- Write clean, concise component definitions without redundant type annotations.

# 8. GIT CONVENTIONAL COMMIT MESSAGES
================================================================================

## .cursorrules file:
Use the Conventional Commit Messages specification to generate commit messages

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
``` 
--------------------------------

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

  - fix: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
  - feat: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
  - BREAKING CHANGE: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
  - types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
  - footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
  - Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.

### Specification Details

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
A footer's token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.
