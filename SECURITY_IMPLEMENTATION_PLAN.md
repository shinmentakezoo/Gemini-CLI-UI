# Security Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing security measures in the web-based IDE, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.

## Goals

1.  **Secure by Design**: Integrate security into every phase of the development lifecycle.
2.  **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls.
3.  **Least Privilege**: Grant users and components the minimum level of access they need to perform their functions.
4.  **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Security Layers

### Authentication and Authorization

-   **Strong Password Policy**: Enforce a strong password policy for user accounts.
-   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement MFA to provide an additional layer of security.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use RBAC to control access to different parts of the application.
-   **Session Management**: Implement secure session management, including session timeouts and secure cookies.

### File System Security

-   **Path Traversal Prevention**: Sanitize all file paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
-   **File Size Limits**: Limit the size of files that can be uploaded or created.
-   **File Type Restrictions**: Restrict the types of files that can be uploaded or created.
-   **Sandboxing**: Run file system operations in a sandboxed environment.

### AI Integration Security

-   **Rate Limiting**: Limit the number of requests that can be sent to the AI service.
-   **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all input sent to the AI service to prevent prompt injection attacks.
-   **Output Filtering**: Filter the output from the AI service to prevent the exposure of sensitive information.
-   **Audit Logging**: Log all AI operations for security and compliance purposes.

### Extension Security

-   **Sandboxing**: Run extensions in a sandboxed environment to isolate them from the main application.
-   **Permissions**: Implement a permission system to control what APIs extensions can access.
-   **Code Signing**: Use code signing to verify the integrity and authenticity of extensions.
-   **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Use a strict CSP to prevent extensions from loading unauthorized scripts or resources.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Threat Modeling**: Perform a threat modeling exercise to identify potential security risks.
2.  **Security Controls**: Implement security controls to mitigate the identified risks.
3.  **Security Testing**: Perform security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify and address security vulnerabilities.
4.  **Security Monitoring**: Implement a security monitoring system to detect and respond to security incidents.
5.  **Security Training**: Provide security training to all developers and other relevant personnel.

## Security Considerations

-   **Third-Party Dependencies**: Be careful about the security of third-party dependencies. Use a tool like `npm audit` to scan for vulnerabilities.
-   **Data Privacy**: Ensure that user data is handled in a way that complies with relevant data privacy regulations, such as GDPR and CCPA.
-   **Incident Response**: Have an incident response plan in place to respond to security incidents in a timely and effective manner.
