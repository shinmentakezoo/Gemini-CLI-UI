# Testing Strategy Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the web-based IDE, ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of the application.

## Goals

1.  **High Quality**: Ensure that the application is free of critical bugs and regressions.
2.  **Reliability**: Ensure that the application is reliable and available when users need it.
3.  **Performance**: Ensure that the application meets its performance goals.
4.  **Automation**: Automate as much of the testing process as possible.

## Testing Pyramid

### Unit Tests (60%)

-   **Description**: Test individual components and functions in isolation.
-   **Framework**: Jest, React Testing Library
-   **Scope**:
    -   React components
    -   Utility functions
    -   API service methods
    -   State management logic

### Integration Tests (30%)

-   **Description**: Test the interaction between different components and services.
-   **Framework**: Jest, Supertest
-   **Scope**:
    -   API endpoints
    -   Database interactions
    -   File system operations
    -   Git workflows
    -   AI chat integration

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests (10%)

-   **Description**: Test complete user workflows from the user's perspective.
-   **Framework**: Playwright
-   **Scope**:
    -   User authentication
    -   File editing and saving
    -   Terminal usage
    -   Debugging sessions
    -   Git operations

## Test Coverage Goals

-   **Overall**: 80%
-   **Critical Paths**: 95%
-   **New Features**: 90%

## Testing Process

1.  **Development**: Developers write unit and integration tests for their code.
2.  **Code Review**: Code reviewers ensure that tests are well-written and provide adequate coverage.
3.  **Continuous Integration (CI)**: The CI pipeline runs all tests automatically on every commit.
4.  **Staging**: E2E tests are run against the staging environment before deploying to production.
5.  **Production**: A subset of E2E tests are run against the production environment to ensure that it is healthy.

## Performance Testing

-   **Load Testing**: Use a tool like k6 to simulate a large number of users and identify performance bottlenecks.
-   **Stress Testing**: Push the application to its limits to see how it behaves under extreme load.
-   **Soak Testing**: Run the application under a normal load for an extended period of time to identify memory leaks and other issues.

## Security Testing

-   **Penetration Testing**: Hire a third-party security firm to perform penetration testing on the application.
-   **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use a tool like OWASP ZAP to scan for common security vulnerabilities.
-   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Use a tool like Snyk to scan the code for security vulnerabilities.
-   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Use a tool like Burp Suite to test the running application for security vulnerabilities.

## Manual Testing

-   **Exploratory Testing**: Testers manually explore the application to find bugs and usability issues.
-   **Usability Testing**: Get feedback from real users to improve the usability of the application.
-   **Cross-Browser Testing**: Manually test the application on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
