# Multi-Tab Interface System Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing a multi-tab interface system in the web-based IDE, allowing users to work with multiple files simultaneously.

## Goals

1.  **Multi-File Editing**: Allow users to open and edit multiple files in different tabs.
2.  **Tab Management**: Provide features for managing tabs, such as opening, closing, reordering, and splitting.
3.  **State Persistence**: Persist the state of the tabs across sessions.
4.  **Seamless Integration**: Integrate with the editor, file explorer, and other features.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (UI)

```typescript
// Tab Manager Component
interface TabManager {
  tabs: Tab[];
  activeTabId: string | null;

  openTab(filePath: string): void;
  closeTab(tabId: string): void;
  reorderTabs(fromIndex: number, toIndex: number): void;
  splitTab(tabId: string, direction: 'horizontal' | 'vertical'): void;
}

// Tab Component
interface Tab {
  id: string;
  filePath: string;
  title: string;
  isDirty: boolean;
  editor: Editor;
}
```

### Backend (Session Service)

```typescript
// Session Service
interface SessionService {
  saveTabs(userId: string, tabs: Tab[]): Promise<void>;
  loadTabs(userId: string): Promise<Tab[]>;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Tab System (Week 1)

1.  **Tab Manager**: Implement a `TabManager` component to manage the state of the tabs.
2.  **Tab UI**: Create a UI for displaying and interacting with the tabs.
3.  **Editor Integration**: Integrate the tab system with the Monaco Editor, so that each tab has its own editor instance.

### Phase 2: Advanced Tab Features (Week 2)

1.  **Tab Reordering**: Add support for reordering tabs using drag and drop.
2.  **Tab Splitting**: Implement a feature that allows users to split a tab horizontally or vertically.
3.  **Dirty State**: Add support for tracking the dirty state of each tab and showing an indicator when a file has unsaved changes.

### Phase 3: State Persistence and Integration (Week 3)

1.  **State Persistence**: Persist the state of the tabs to the database, so that they can be restored across sessions.
2.  **File Explorer Integration**: Integrate the tab system with the file explorer, so that clicking on a file opens it in a new tab.
3.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for the multi-tab interface system.

## Security Considerations

-   **Data Validation**: Validate all data related to tabs before saving it to the database.
-   **Access Control**: Ensure that users can only access their own tabs.
