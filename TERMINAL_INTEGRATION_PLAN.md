# Terminal Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating an enhanced terminal into the web-based IDE, replacing any existing terminal functionality with a more powerful and feature-rich solution based on xterm.js and node-pty.

## Goals

1. **Full-featured Terminal**: Provide a complete terminal experience with shell access, multiple tabs, and customization.
2. **Seamless Integration**: Integrate with the existing UI and backend services.
3. **Performance**: Ensure low latency and high performance.
4. **Security**: Implement proper security measures to prevent abuse.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (xterm.js)

```typescript
// xterm.js Configuration
interface XTermConfig {
  cursorBlink: boolean;
  cursorStyle: 'block' | 'underline' | 'bar';
  fontSize: number;
  fontFamily: string;
  theme: {
    background: string;
    foreground: string;
    cursor: string;
    selection: string;
  };
}

// Terminal Component
interface TerminalComponent {
  terminal: Terminal;
  fitAddon: FitAddon;

  initialize(container: HTMLElement, config: XTermConfig): void;
  connect(socket: WebSocket): void;
  resize(): void;
  dispose(): void;
}
```

### Backend (node-pty)

```typescript
// PTY Process Manager
interface PtyManager {
  createPtyProcess(options: PtyOptions): PtyProcess;
  getPtyProcess(id: string): PtyProcess | undefined;
  killPtyProcess(id: string): void;
}

// PTY Process
interface PtyProcess {
  id: string;
  process: IPty;
  
  onData(callback: (data: string) => void): void;
  write(data: string): void;
  resize(cols: number, rows: number): void;
  kill(): void;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 1)

1.  **Dependencies**: Add `xterm`, `xterm-addon-fit`, and `node-pty` to the project.
2.  **Backend Setup**: Create a `PtyManager` to create and manage pseudo-terminals.
3.  **WebSocket Communication**: Establish a WebSocket connection between the frontend terminal and the backend PTY process.
4.  **Basic Terminal Component**: Create a React component that renders an xterm.js terminal and connects it to the backend.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Week 2)

1.  **Multiple Tabs**: Implement a tabbed interface to manage multiple terminal sessions.
2.  **Theming**: Add support for custom themes and allow users to switch between them.
3.  **Search Functionality**: Integrate the `xterm-addon-search` to enable searching within the terminal buffer.
4.  **Copy-Paste**: Ensure seamless copy-paste functionality between the terminal and the rest of the application.

### Phase 3: Integration and Polish (Week 3)

1.  **Shell Integration**: Implement shell integration to provide features like command history and current working directory tracking.
2.  **Link Handling**: Use the `xterm-addon-web-links` to make URLs in the terminal clickable.
3.  **UI Polish**: Refine the UI/UX of the terminal, including scrollbars, tab styles, and context menus.
4.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the terminal functionality.

## Security Considerations

-   **Process Sandboxing**: Run PTY processes in a sandboxed environment to prevent them from accessing unauthorized resources.
-   **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all input sent to the terminal to prevent command injection attacks.
-   **Resource Limiting**: Limit the number of concurrent terminal sessions per user and the resources they can consume.
-   **Authentication**: Ensure that only authenticated users can create and interact with terminal sessions.
