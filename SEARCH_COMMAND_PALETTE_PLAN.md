# Global Search and Command Palette Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for integrating global search and a command palette into the web-based IDE, providing a powerful way for users to find files, symbols, and execute commands.

## Goals

1.  **Fast and Accurate Search**: Provide a fast and accurate search experience across the entire project.
2.  **Powerful Command Palette**: Create a command palette that allows users to execute any command in the IDE.
3.  **Seamless Integration**: Integrate with the editor, file explorer, and other features.
4.  **Extensibility**: Allow extensions to contribute their own search providers and commands.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend (UI)

```typescript
// Search Panel Component
interface SearchPanel {
  search(query: string, options: SearchOptions): Promise<SearchResult[]>;
  replace(query: string, replace: string, options: SearchOptions): Promise<void>;
}

// Command Palette Component
interface CommandPalette {
  show(): void;
  hide(): void;
  registerCommand(command: Command): void;
}
```

### Backend (Search and Command Service)

```typescript
// Search Service
interface SearchService {
  searchProject(query: string, options: SearchOptions): Promise<SearchResult[]>;
  searchSymbol(query: string, options: SearchOptions): Promise<SymbolSearchResult[]>;
}

// Command Service
interface CommandService {
  executeCommand(id: string, ...args: any[]): Promise<any>;
  getCommands(): Command[];
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Global Search (Week 1-2)

1.  **Backend Search Service**: Implement a search service that can search for text and symbols across the project. Use a fast search tool like `ripgrep`.
2.  **Frontend Search Panel**: Create a search panel that allows users to enter search queries and view the results.
3.  **Editor Integration**: Highlight search results in the editor and provide a way to navigate between them.
4.  **Find and Replace**: Add support for finding and replacing text across multiple files.

### Phase 2: Command Palette (Week 3)

1.  **Backend Command Service**: Implement a command service that can execute commands from different parts of the application.
2.  **Frontend Command Palette**: Create a command palette UI that allows users to search for and execute commands.
3.  **Command Registration**: Create a mechanism for different parts of the application to register their own commands.
4.  **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard shortcuts for opening the command palette and executing common commands.

### Phase 3: Extensibility (Week 4)

1.  **Search Provider API**: Create an API that allows extensions to contribute their own search providers.
2.  **Command Provider API**: Create an API that allows extensions to contribute their own commands.
3.  **Testing**: Write comprehensive tests for the search and command palette features.

## Security Considerations

-   **Search Scope**: Ensure that the search is limited to the user's project directory and does not expose sensitive files.
-   **Command Execution**: Be careful about allowing extensions to execute arbitrary commands. Implement a permission system to control what commands extensions can execute.
